This an alpaha version of a program designed to test the degeneracy of rna code. At the moment you have to place an rna sequence under rnasequence.txt. It will translate
the code and then create point mutations. It then compares the two sequences to show % of RNA and proteins conserved.

To do: 
implement exceptions
allow for several types of mutations other than point mutations
